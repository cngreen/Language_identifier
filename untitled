paper considers problem calculating viscous aerodynamic
characteristics blunt bodies hypersonic speeds
sufficiently high altitudes appropriate mean free
path becomes too large use familiar boundary-layer
theory not so large free molecule concepts apply
results order-of-magnitude analysis presented
define regimes rarefied gas flow limits continuum
theory based theoretical experimental evidence
complete navier-stokes equations used
model except very close free molecule condition
model may not necessarily give shock wave structure
detail satisfies overall conservation laws should give 
reasonably accurate picture mean aerodynamic quantities
intermediate regime two fundamental classes
problems viscous layer class merged layer
class latter corresponding larger degree rarefaction
viscous layer class there thin shock wave
shock layer region between shock body fully viscous
although viscous stresses conductive heat transfer
small shock wave boundary use
navier-stokes equations outer boundary conditions given
hugoniot relations justified merged layer
class shock wave no longer thin navier-stokes
equations can used give solution includes shock
structure has free-stream conditions outer boundary conditions
simpler procedure presented incipient merged
conditions shock may no longer considered infinitesimally
thin discontinuity not thickened
sufficiently entail fully merged layer analysis
case approximate shock discontinuity obeying conservation
laws include curvature effects viscous stresses
heat conduction 
sphere cylinder shown navier-stokes
equations can reduced ordinary differential equations
both viscous merged layer class problems solutions
these equations used connection hypersonic flow
problems general only valid stagnation region
illustrate viscous layer solutions numerical calculations
performed sphere cylinder assumption
constant density shock layer useful
approximation hypersonic speeds illustrate merged
layer solution calculations been carried out sphere
using incipient merged layer approximation 
results presented detachment distance surface shear
heat-transfer rate stagnation region highly cooled
sphere flying hypersonic speed decreasing reynolds
number shear heat transfer shown increase above
extrapolated boundary-layer values viscous layer
regime then begin falling incipient merged regime
reynolds number decreases incipient merged
regime density shock layer increases static
stagnation enthalpy behind shock decrease 
calculations performed insulated sphere show
decreasing reynolds number incipient merged regime
density shock layer decreases total enthalpy behind
shock stagnation point increase so they
higher than free-stream total enthalpy stagnation-point
pressure behaves like total enthalpy
highly cooled cylinder viscous layer regime
same quantities presented sphere increase
found shear heat transfer above extrapolated boundarylayer
theory small agreement vorticity interaction

discussion given behavior available experimental
data viscous flow quantities intermediate regime behavior predicted results present calculations
qualitative agreement indicated
